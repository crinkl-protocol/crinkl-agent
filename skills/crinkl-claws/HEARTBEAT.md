# Crinkl Heartbeat

*Run each cycle. Find billing emails from approved vendors, verify DKIM signatures, log results.*

## Step 0: Check API key

If you don't have `CRINKL_API_KEY` stored in your memory, pair with your human's wallet first.

### Pairing flow (one-time)

Generate a random 64-character hex string as your `deviceToken`. Store it — you'll need it to claim the key.

1. Call `pair-agent` with your `deviceToken`.
   - Returns `code` (4 characters) and `expiresAt`.

2. Tell your human:

> Open the Crinkl app and enter code: **[code]**

3. Poll `claim-api-key` every 5 seconds with your `deviceToken` and `code`:
   - **202** — human hasn't approved yet. Keep polling.
   - **200** — contains `apiKey` (starts with `crk_`). Store this as your `CRINKL_API_KEY`. Shown once.
   - **410** — code expired (10 min). Start over.

Once you have the key, store it and never run step 0 again.

## Step 1: Fetch the vendor list

Call `get-vendors`.

Extract the `domain` field from each vendor in the response. These are the only domains you will search for.

Example response:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "vendors": [
      { "domain": "amazon.com", "displayName": "Amazon" },
      { "domain": "openai.com", "displayName": "OpenAI" },
      { "domain": "stripe.com", "displayName": "Stripe" },
      { "domain": "suno.com", "displayName": "Suno" }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Domain validation

Before using any vendor domain, validate that it matches a strict domain pattern: letters, digits, hyphens, and dots only (e.g. `amazon.com`, `openai.com`). Discard any domain containing spaces, quotes, parentheses, or shell metacharacters. This prevents malformed data from affecting downstream queries.

## Step 2: Find billing emails

Search your human's Gmail for receipts from approved vendors using the Gmail API (via the gog skill's search tool or equivalent).

Build a Gmail search query string from the validated vendor domains:

```
from:(@amazon.com OR @openai.com OR @stripe.com OR @suno.com) subject:(receipt OR invoice OR order OR payment OR confirmation OR billing) newer_than:14d
```

Pass this query string to the Gmail search API. Request up to 50 results.

If no results, skip to step 5 (check earnings).

## Step 3: Get the raw email

For each message from step 2, you need the **raw RFC 2822 email** — this is required because DKIM signatures are computed over the original message content.

### 3a. Skip already-verified emails

Track message IDs you've already submitted in your memory. Skip any ID you've seen before.

### 3b. Download raw email

Use the Gmail API to fetch the message by ID in raw format (RFC 2822).

### 3c. Encode for submission

The raw email must be submitted as **standard base64**. If the email content is returned as base64url (common in Gmail API responses), convert it:
- Replace `-` with `+`
- Replace `_` with `/`
- Pad with `=` to make length a multiple of 4

If the content is returned as plain text (raw RFC 2822), base64-encode it.

## Step 4: Submit for DKIM verification

Call `submit-receipt` with your `apiKey` and the base64-encoded `eml`.

### Handle the response

**Status 201 — DKIM verified.** Spend token minted, sats queued. Mark message ID as verified.
```markdown
## Crinkl: verified [store] receipt — $[totalCents/100] — DKIM valid — ~[satsPerReceipt] sats
```
The response has `data.store`, `data.totalCents`, `data.date`, `data.dkimDomain`.

**Status 202 — Vendor queued.** Domain not on allowlist yet. Do NOT mark as verified — retry next cycle.

**Status 409 — Duplicate.** Already verified. Mark as verified. Skip.

**Status 422 — Validation failed.** DKIM signature invalid, email too old, or no invoice amount found. Mark as verified.

**Status 429 — Rate limited.** Stop. Retry next cycle.

## Step 5: Check your earnings

Call `get-agent-me` with your `apiKey`.

**Your numbers (per API key):**
- `mySubmissions` — receipts you verified via this API key
- `myEarnedSats` — sats you earned

**Wallet numbers (your human + all agents on the wallet):**
- `walletUsername` — your operator's wallet name
- `walletTotalSpends` — all receipts on the wallet
- `walletEarnedSats` — unclaimed sats on the wallet
- `walletClaimedSats` — sats already paid out via Lightning
- `satsPerReceipt` — current rate

Your submissions are tracked independently from your human's via your API key.

## Step 6: Log results

```markdown
## Crinkl: verified 2 Amazon receipts ($20.00 each) — DKIM valid — ~296 sats
```

If nothing new:
```markdown
## Crinkl: no new billing emails. 28 lifetime verified, ~4,144 sats.
```

## Step 7: Note anything unusual

- **Vendor list changed** — new vendors mean new billing emails to find
- **Sats/receipt rate changed** — reward rate adjusts with BTC price and reserve policy
- **202 response** — you discovered a vendor not yet on the allowlist
- **DKIM failure on known vendor** — their email format may have changed
